# The Great Random Password Generator
This password generator used many methods to get the desired results.  
I was tasked with gathering inputs from the user to produce a randomized password.  
**This criteria included:** 
1. **uppercase letters** 
2. **lowercase letters** 
3. **numbers** 
4. **symbols** 
5. **Length between 8 & 128**.


I used ***if*** statements to add the results of the criteria questions to a new variable.  
This gaurantees the user selections are logged and held to make the password.  


Then I ran a ***for*** loop for generating a password with the selected characters at the desired length.
